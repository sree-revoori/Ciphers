# Ciphers
A repository of various ciphers and cryptosytems that I have programmed. My goal is to eventually create some sort of interactive application where a user can see the effects of each cryptosystem on their plaintext. I am currently in the process of encapsulating both of these functionalities in an open-source python cryptography library that anyone can use. 

### Available Functionalities
  - Caesar Cipher
  - Vigenere Cipher
  - Affine Cipher
  - Enigma Cipher
  - RSA
  - Cryptographic Computational Tests
    - Miller-Rabin Test
    - Index of Coincidence
  - ADFGVX Cipher
